# Prediction of Tehran Stock Market Index using LSTM and GRU with TensorFlow
This project implements a time-series prediction model for the Tehran Stock Market Index (TEPIX) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks with TensorFlow. The model uses daily closing prices of TEPIX from 2015 to 2021 to predict future prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical daily closing prices of TEPIX from 2020 to 2022. The dataset is preprocessed to remove missing values and is split into training and testing sets.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following:

Python 3.6 or later
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

## Results
The performance of the LSTM and GRU models is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) metrics.
